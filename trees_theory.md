## 🌲 What Is a Tree in DSA?

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure made up of nodes connected by edges. It starts with a **root node**, and each node can have child nodes, forming a branching structure.

- **Parent node**: Immediate predecessor of a node
- **Child node**: Immediate successor of a node
- **Leaf node**: Node with no children
- **Subtree**: A tree formed by a node and its descendants
- **Depth**: Distance from root to a node
- **Height**: Distance from a node to its deepest leaf

Trees are **non-linear**, unlike arrays or linked lists, making them ideal for representing hierarchical data like file systems, DOM structures, and organizational charts.

## 🌳 Types of Trees

Here’s a breakdown of key tree types and their use cases:

| Tree Type           | Description                                                                 | Use Case Examples                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Binary Tree**     | Each node has at most two children                                          | Basic tree traversal, expression trees     |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Left child < parent < right child                                     | Fast lookup, insertion, deletion           |
| **AVL Tree**        | Self-balancing BST                                                          | Ensures O(log n) operations                |
| **Red-Black Tree**  | Balanced BST with color properties                                          | Used in Java TreeMap, Linux kernel         |
| **Segment Tree**    | Stores intervals and supports range queries                                 | Range sum/min/max queries                  |
| **Trie (Prefix Tree)** | Stores strings efficiently by character                                   | Autocomplete, spell-check, IP routing      |
| **B-Trees / B+ Trees** | Multi-way balanced trees used in databases                                | Indexing in databases and file systems     |
| **Heap (Binary Heap)** | Complete binary tree with heap property                                   | Priority queues, heap sort                 |

## 🔍 Core Operations

- **Traversal**: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level-order
- **Insertion/Deletion**: Varies by tree type (e.g., BST vs AVL)
- **Searching**: Efficient in BST, Trie, and balanced trees
- **Balancing**: AVL and Red-Black trees maintain balance to optimize performance

## 🧠 Why Trees Matter for You

Given your interest in scalable architectures and modular code, trees offer:

- **Efficient search and retrieval** (O(log n) in balanced trees)
- **Modular recursive logic** — perfect for your Python and Go/gRPC backend work
- **Real-world modeling** — from UI hierarchies in React to routing in distributed systems
