letâ€™s break down the comparison between a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and an **AVL Tree** so you can clearly see how they differ and when to use each.

## ðŸŒ³ Binary Search Tree vs AVL Tree

| Feature                  | Binary Search Tree (BST)                                | AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree)                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**            | Each node has â‰¤ 2 children: left < root < right          | Same as BST, but with added balance enforcement             |
| **Balance Factor**       | Not enforced â€” tree can become skewed                   | Strictly maintained: must be -1, 0, or +1 at every node      |
| **Performance**          | Worst-case: O(n) if unbalanced                          | Always O(log n) for insert, delete, and search              |
| **Rotations**            | None                                                     | Uses left, right, left-right, and right-left rotations      |
| **Height Tracking**      | Not required                                             | Each node stores its height for balance calculations        |
| **Use Case**             | Simple insert/search when data is random or balanced    | Critical when consistent performance is needed (e.g. DBs)   |
| **Memory Overhead**      | Lower â€” no height tracking                              | Slightly higher â€” stores height and may rotate              |
| **Insertion Complexity** | Simple recursive insert                                 | Insert + check balance + rotate if needed                   |

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaway

- A **BST** is easier to implement and works well if your data is naturally balanced.
- An **AVL Tree** guarantees balance, making it ideal for performance-critical systems like databases, caches, and real-time apps.
